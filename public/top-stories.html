<h2>The Top Stories</h2>
<ul></ul>
<h3><li>Hurricane Fishing</li></h3>
  <ul>Nothing beats standing on a life guard chair at midnight in pitch black <br>
    skies fishing while a hurricane is coming in. The attempt to fish was futile <br>
    as this was a fight for survival. We escaped the lifeguard chair as the water <br>
    levels rose. Swimming to the shore with fishing gear in hand. <br>

<h3><li>Building Climbing</li></h3>
    <ul>We climbed a building Pammy (RIP🪦) always said was run by gangsters. <br>
        We hopped from pole to AC unit to small ledge to eventually on the roof. <br>
        I remember sending a picture to Pammy and could hear her yell from <br>
        Bud's (also RIP 🪦) house. <br>

<h3><li>Pepto Bismol + Fire Hour Energy</li></h3>
    <ul>Ah yes, the 12 hour drive that almost killed us both. I may have had a <br>
        slight overdose on 5 Hour Energy and Pepto Bismol. I suffered from <br>
        extreme nausea and shakes and was also falling asleep. "STOP SWERVING" <BR>
        I had screamed at me nearly 100 times. <br>

<h3><li>Tropy's Take North Carolina</li></h3>
      <ul>A rendezvous heard around the world. We met in Jacksonville City, NC <br>
      and a great week. Aquariums, beach time, good eats, and all the Pokemon <br>
      playing two nerds could ask for. <br>
